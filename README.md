# Overview
Implementation of _Fast Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network ( FSRCNN )_ Model for image super resolution task with PyTorch framework. A custom dataset class is also implemented to segregate and pre-process High-resolution and Low-resolution images from the BSD100, Set5, Set14 and Urban100 datasets available online.
